These are the exercise files for my Web Design Fundamentals course on lynda.com. These are basic HTML files that allow students to write simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript. They probably won't be much use to anyone outside of those taking the course, but feel free to explore and play around with them as much as you'd like!

Thanks! James Williamson
